Essentially it's the original Pok√©mon combat system where, each character has 4 attacks and a meter for those attacks. Maybe we can implement a random number generator to have it deal out the damage. If it's in a certain range, it's a weak attack, normal, or a critical attack.

Another thought I had was about how we can have the character progression through the story. I really liked your idea about escape rooms and modified it a bit. Idk if you've ever heard/played a board game called Munchkin, if not, a quick summary is an RPG based board game where each character builds up themselves with items and classes. Every player starts the game at room 1 with the goal of reaching the final room, which is room 10. Maybe we can do the room progression as a way to write different parts of the story and it helps with character progression.
