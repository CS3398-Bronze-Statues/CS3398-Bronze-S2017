This is a Python text-based adventure game that revolves around escaping from a dystopian country. You are part of a slave race. Your every activity is highly restricted and controlled, and you are closely monitored at all times. Escaping is nearly impossible. In order to make it out alive, you must seek out those who have information, determine whether you can trust them, and prove yourself worthy of their trust. However, you are forbidden from communicating with most people, and you can only access locations during times you are scheduled to be there.
